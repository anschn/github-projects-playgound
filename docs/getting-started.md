# Getting Started with GitHub Projects

This guide will help you set up your first GitHub Project in this playground repository.

## What is GitHub Projects?

GitHub Projects is a built-in project management tool that helps you organize and track work across repositories. It provides flexible views, automation capabilities, and integration with GitHub issues and pull requests.

## Creating Your First Project

### 1. Navigate to Projects

1. Go to the repository's **Projects** tab
2. Click **"New project"**
3. Choose a template or start from scratch

### 2. Choose Your View

GitHub Projects offers several view types:

- **Board View**: Kanban-style boards with columns
- **Table View**: Spreadsheet-like interface
- **Timeline View**: Gantt chart for tracking progress over time
- **Roadmap View**: High-level planning view

### 3. Add Items

You can add various types of items to your project:

- **Issues**: Existing or new repository issues
- **Pull Requests**: Link PRs to track development progress
- **Draft Issues**: Quick notes that can become full issues later

### 4. Configure Fields

Customize your project with fields like:

- **Status**: Track progress (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- **Priority**: Set importance levels
- **Assignee**: Assign team members
- **Labels**: Categorize items
- **Custom Fields**: Create project-specific metadata

## Basic Workflows

### Simple Kanban Board

1. Create columns: "Backlog", "In Progress", "Review", "Done"
2. Add issues to the backlog
3. Move items through columns as work progresses
4. Use automation to update status automatically

### Sprint Planning

1. Use the table view for detailed planning
2. Add custom fields for story points and sprint
3. Filter items by sprint to focus on current work
4. Use timeline view to visualize sprint progress

## Next Steps

- Explore [Project Views](project-views.md) to understand different visualization options
- Set up [Automation](automation.md) to streamline your workflow
- Check out [Examples](examples/) for ready-to-use configurations

## Tips for Success

- Start simple and add complexity gradually
- Use consistent naming conventions for fields and labels
- Regularly review and adjust your project structure
- Take advantage of GitHub's built-in integrations
