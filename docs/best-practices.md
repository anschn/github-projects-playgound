# Best Practices for GitHub Projects

This guide outlines recommended practices for using GitHub Projects effectively in your workflow.

## Project Organization

### Structure Your Projects Thoughtfully

- **One Project per Team/Initiative**: Keep projects focused and manageable
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for projects and fields
- **Logical Grouping**: Organize items in a way that matches your team's workflow

### Field Management

- **Keep Fields Relevant**: Only add fields that provide value to your team
- **Use Standard Values**: Establish consistent options for select fields
- **Document Field Purposes**: Make sure team members understand what each field represents

## Workflow Design

### Start Simple

```
Backlog â†’ In Progress â†’ Review â†’ Done
```

- Begin with a basic workflow
- Add complexity as your team becomes comfortable
- Regularly evaluate and adjust your process

### Use Automation Wisely

- **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Status updates, label additions, assignments
- **Don't Over-Automate**: Keep some manual control for flexibility
- **Test Automations**: Verify rules work as expected before relying on them

## Team Collaboration

### Clear Ownership

- **Assign Items**: Every task should have a clear owner
- **Use Descriptive Titles**: Make it easy to understand what work is needed
- **Regular Updates**: Keep status current to maintain visibility

### Communication

- **Use Comments**: Provide context and updates within items
- **Link Related Work**: Connect issues, PRs, and discussions
- **Document Decisions**: Record important choices and rationale

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews

- **Weekly Team Reviews**: Check project status and adjust priorities
- **Monthly Structure Reviews**: Evaluate if your project structure still serves your needs
- **Quarterly Process Reviews**: Assess and improve your overall workflow

### Keep It Clean

- **Archive Completed Work**: Move finished items out of active views
- **Close Stale Issues**: Regularly review and close outdated items
- **Update Documentation**: Keep project descriptions and field definitions current

## Performance Tips

### Efficient Views

- **Use Filters**: Create focused views for different work types
- **Group Strategically**: Group by status, assignee, or priority as needed
- **Limit Columns**: Too many columns can make boards hard to navigate

### Effective Filtering

```markdown
Examples of useful filters:
- `assignee:@me` - Show only your assigned items
- `status:"In Progress"` - Focus on active work
- `label:bug` - Filter by specific issue types
```

### Custom Fields Best Practices

- **Priority**: Use consistent scale (High/Medium/Low or 1-5)
- **Story Points**: Helps with sprint planning and velocity tracking
- **Sprint**: Track work across iterations
- **Epic**: Group related work items

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Over-Engineering

- Don't create overly complex workflows from the start
- Avoid too many custom fields initially
- Resist the urge to automate everything immediately

### Neglecting Maintenance

- Projects need regular attention to stay useful
- Outdated information reduces team confidence
- Inconsistent usage leads to confusion

### Poor Communication

- Don't assume everyone understands your project structure
- Provide training and documentation for new team members
- Regularly check if the project serves everyone's needs

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Issue Management

- Create issues directly from project items when needed
- Use issue templates to ensure consistency
- Link issues to pull requests for complete tracking

### Code Review Process

- Track PR review status in your project
- Use automation to move items when PRs are merged
- Connect project items to deployment status

### Release Planning

- Use milestones in conjunction with projects
- Plan releases using timeline or roadmap views
- Track feature completion across multiple repositories

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

- **Velocity**: Track completion rate over time
- **Cycle Time**: Measure how long items take to complete
- **Burn-down**: Monitor progress toward goals

### Regular Assessment

- Ask team members what's working and what isn't
- Experiment with new approaches in small increments
- Document successful patterns for reuse
